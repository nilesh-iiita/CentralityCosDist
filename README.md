## About

**CentralityCosDist** is an algorithm that ranks nodes in a biological network based on a combination of centrality measures and seed nodes. The centrality measures are based on the node's connections to other nodes, while the seed nodes are nodes that are known to be important. The algorithm ranks the nodes by giving them a score that is based on their centrality measures and how many seed nodes they are connected to.

**CentralityCosDist** is a useful tool for identifying the most important nodes in a biological network. It can be used to understand the function of the network and the role of individual nodes.
